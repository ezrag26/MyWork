C++ Prerequisites Quiz

1. int x = 10;
What are the types, values and side-effects of the following expressions:

x -> literal, 10, no side effect
‘x’ -> literal, 'x', no side effect
x+1 -> addition, 11, no side effect
x++ -> postfix, 10, increments x by 1 and assign it to x after x's original value is used
++x -> prefix, 11, increments x by 1 and assign it to x, and then use x

2. int *foo(void);
What are the types of the following expressions? Which of them are lvalues?

*foo() -> dereference function return, rvalue
&foo() -> reference of function return, rvalue
foo() -> function call, lvalue.
foo -> function reference, rvalue
&foo -> function reference, rvalue

3. What is a weak symbol?
In C, a weak symbol is a global variable not initialized, just defined, and if there is a variable with the same name within the same compilation unit that has strong symbol, the weak symbol will be overriden and take the strong symbol's value
In C++, there are no weak symbols by default. To make a symbol weak, it should be declared as _attribute_((weak))

4. What are calling conventions? Describe the steps of a function call in C on an x86 platform.
Good luck!
    1. The caller saves the contents of certain registers
    2. Arguments are passed on the stack from right to left, and return values are passed in eax register.
    3. calling function cleans the stack
    4. return value is retrieved from eax register
    5. caller restores the content previously saved from the registers before the call
